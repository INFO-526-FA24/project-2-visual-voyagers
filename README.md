## Project 2 - Visual Voyagers

### Project Overview
This project is part of INFO 526 (Fall 2024) and is a team effort by the Visual Voyagers. Our goal is to study and visualize data about cancer to find patterns, trends, and factors that could improve understanding of this disease. We will use machine learning methods to uncover useful insights.

### Objectives - 
1) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the cancer data to make it ready for analysis.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Looking for important patterns and trends in the data.

3) Statistical Analysis: Using different statistical tools to explore the links between the data points.

4) Visualization: Making charts and graphs to explain our findings in a clear way.
